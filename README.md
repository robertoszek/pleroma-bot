Mirror one or multiple Twitter accounts in Pleroma/Mastodon.

## Introduction

After using the pretty cool [mastodon-bot](https://github.com/yogthos/mastodon-bot) for a while, I found it was lacking some actions which were of use to me. 

For precisely those cases I've written this Python project that automates them, asking such info to [Twitter's API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1) and updating the relevant fields on the [Pleroma API](https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/API/pleroma_api/) side.


So basically, it does the following:

* Retrieves **last 'max_tweets' tweets** and posts them on the Fediverse account if their timestamp is newer than the last post. 
* Gets the **display name** from Twitter and updates it in on the Fediverse account
* Gets the **profile picture** from Twitter and updates it on the Fediverse account
* Gets the **banner image** from Twitter and updates it on the Fediverse account
* Gets the **bio text** from Twitter and updates it on the Fediverse account
* Adds some **metadata fields** to the Fediverse account, pointing to the original Twitter account

## Installation
```
$ pip install pleroma-bot
```
## Usage
```console
$ pleroma-bot [noProfile]
```
### Before running
You'll need the following:

* A [Twitter Bearer Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/api-reference/token)
* The user/users [Pleroma Bearer Tokens](https://tinysubversions.com/notes/mastodon-bot/)

Create a ```config.yml``` file in the same path where you are calling ```pleroma-bot```. There's a config example in this repo called ```config.yml.sample``` that can help you when filling yours out:
```yaml
twitter_base_url: https://api.twitter.com/1.1
# Change this to your Fediverse instance
pleroma_base_url: https://pleroma.robertoszek.xyz
# How many tweets to get in every execution
# Twitter's API hard limit is 3,200
max_tweets: 40
# Twitter bearer token
twitter_token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# List of users and their attributes
users:
- twitter_username: KyleBosman
  pleroma_username: KyleBosman
  pleroma_token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  # If you want to add a link to the original status or not
  signature: true
  # If you want to download Twitter attachments and add them to the Pleroma posts
  media_upload: true
  # If twitter links should be changed to nitter.net ones
  nitter: true
  # If mentions should be transformed to links to the mentioned Twitter profile
  rich_text: true
  # visibility of the post. Must one of the following: public, unlisted, private, direct
  visibility: "unlisted"
  # Force all posts for this account to be sensitive or not
  # The NSFW banner for the instance will be shown for attachments as a warning if true
  # If not defined, the original tweet sensitivity will be used on a tweet by tweet basis
  sensitive: false
  support_account: robertoszek
  # you can use any attribute from 'user' inside a string with {{ attr_name }} and it will be replaced
  # with the attribute value. e.g. {{ support_account }}
  bio_text: "\U0001F916 BEEP BOOP \U0001F916 \nI'm a bot that mirrors {{ twitter_username }} Twitter's\
    \ account. \nAny issues please contact @{{ support_account }} \n \n " # username will be replaced by its value
  # Optional metadata fields and values for the Pleroma profile
  fields:
  - name: "\U0001F426 Birdsite"
    value: "{{ twitter_url }}"
  - name: "Status"
    value: "I am completely operational, and all my circuits are functioning perfectly."
  - name: "Source"
    value: "https://gitea.robertoszek.xyz/robertoszek/pleroma-twitter-info-grabber"
- twitter_username: arstechnica
  pleroma_username: mynewsbot
  pleroma_token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  signature: true
  nitter: true
  media_upload: false
  pleroma_url: https://another.pleroma.instance
  max_tweets: 50
  bio_text: "\U0001F916 BEEP BOOP \U0001F916 \n I'm a bot that mirrors {{ twitter_username }} Twitter's\
    \ account. \n Any issues please contact @robertoszek \n \n "
```
Changing the ```users``` to the desired ones. You can add as many users as needed.

Also change the following to your Pleroma/Mastodon instance URL:
```yaml
pleroma_base_url: https://pleroma.robertoszek.xyz
```
### Running

If the ```noProfile``` argument is passed, *only* new tweets will be posted. The profile picture, banner, display name and bio will **not** be updated on the Fediverse account.

NOTE: An ```error.log``` file will be created at the path from which ```pleroma-bot``` is being called.

### crontab entry example 
**(everyday at 6:15 AM)** update profile and **(every 10 min.)** post new tweets:
```bash
# Post tweets every 10 min
*/10 * * * * cd /home/robertoszek/myvenv/ && . bin/activate && pleroma-bot noProfile

# Update pleroma profile with Twitter info every day at 6:15 AM
15 6 * * * cd /home/robertoszek/myvenv/ && . bin/activate && pleroma-bot
```
## Acknowledgements
These projects proved to be immensely useful, they are Python wrappers for the Mastodon API and Twitter API respectively:

* [Mastodon.py](https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py)
* [twitter-python](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter)

They were part of the impetus for this project, challenging myself to not just import them and use them, instead opting to directly do the heavy lifting with built-in python modules. 

That and [mastodon-bot](https://github.com/yogthos/mastodon-bot) not working after upgrading the Pleroma instance I was admin on ðŸ˜…. This event lead to repurposing it and adding the tweet gathering and posting capabilities.
